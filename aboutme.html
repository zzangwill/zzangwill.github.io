    I am Zepora, a 2020 gradute of UC Berkeley with Bachelors of Arts in Economics and Molecular and Cell Biology. I am currently an Emergency Medical Technician at NorCal Ambulance, specifically on their PICU (pediatric intensive care unit) dedicated team providing EMTs for the Kaiser Oakland PICU.
    
    <p>
      I played lacrosse on the UC Berkeley Women's Club Lacrosse team, and try to nurture this habit even in my post-grad era. However I do find myself playing tennis more often, even though lacrosse will always have my heart! As you can probably tell, I love reading, with my favorite genres including fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction.
    </p>

    <p>I also have a slight addiction to video games. My favorite of all time right now is Hollow Knight, but I have more hours clocked in Valorant and Apex Legends. However my heart stays loyal to immersive, single-player RPGs such as the Horizon games, Ghost of Tsushima, Assassin's Creed, and Red Dead Redeption 2.</p>

    <p>
      I took a student-led class about coding when COVID cancelled my plans of having a rambunctious senior year (and I therefore overloaded myself with classes), which is what allowed and inspured me to make this website. However, as you can see, I do not possess the skillful intuition to apply all that I learned, but I am trying! I am always working on improving this space and adding content (specifically recipes).
