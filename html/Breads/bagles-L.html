            <ul>
                <li class="ingredient">
                   2 quart water (4 cups)
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1/4 cup honey (60g) or barely malt syrup
                </li>

        <div id="secton2">
            <p class="directions">
                Prepare dough: Whisk the warm water and yeast together in a large bowl. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Add the flour, brown sugar, and salt. 
                Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough is very stiff and will look somewhat dry.
            </p>

            <p class="directions">
                Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, 
                knead the dough for 4-5 minutes (the dough is too heavy for the mixer to knead).
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, 
                turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise 
                at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Shape the bagels: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. 
                Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape each into a bagel. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with 
                kitchen towel and rest for a few minutes as you prepare the water bath.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Water bath: Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water. Whisk in the honey. 
                Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop bagels in, 2-4 at a time, 
                making sure they have enough room to float around. Cook the bagels for 1 minute on each side.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Using a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. Place bagels onto 
                each lined baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. You want the bagels to be 
                a dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow bagels to cool on the baking sheets for 20 minutes, 
                then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
