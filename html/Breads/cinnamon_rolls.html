                Make the sweet dough recipe as instructed. After the rise, punch the dough down and then roll it out into a large rectangle.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Spread the melted butter over the dough. Mix together the sugar and spices, and then sprinkle that evenly over the dough.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Roll the dough up, rolling from the longest side so you get as much spiral as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Cut it into about 12 pieces. You can modulate how many you cut so they fit into your container. If you make them bigger, then they will just be taller rolls.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Arrange them in a baking vessel so it is full but they are not tightly pressed up against each other, so there is room to expand.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Let rise for 1-1.5 hours. You can also cover the rolls and refrigerate overnight. Then the next day, let them rise at room temperature for about 1 hour before baking.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Preheat oven to 350°F.

                Bake for 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Make the icing in a bowl by hand, or in a stand-mixer. Once the rolls are out, let them slightly cool before applying icing. Serve and enjoy.
