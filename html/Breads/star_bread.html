                   1 large eggs
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">

                 </li>
                 <li class="ingredient">
                1 tsp salt

                </li>

            </ul> 

            <p>Filling (varations):</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    Cinnamon Sugar: Spread 1 Tablespoon of very soft unsalted butter onto each of the 3 circles. (3 Tbsp total.) Mix 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar with 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon. This is the total amount and you will divide it between each circle. Sprinkle evenly over butter on each circle.
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    Nutella: Spread 1 heaping Tablespoon of Nutella onto each of the 3 circles. Nutella is difficult to spread onto soft dough, so warm it up in the microwave for a few seconds until it’s a spreadable consistency.
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    Your favorite jam: Spread 1 Tablespoon of jam onto each of the 3 circles.
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    Butter, Brown Sugar, + Ginger: Spread 1 Tablespoon of very soft unsalted butter onto each of the 3 circles. Mix 3 Tablespoons packed light or dark brown sugar with 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1 Tablespoon finely chopped crystallized ginger. Sprinkle evenly over butter on each circle.
                </li>

                Make the dough: Place the yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle 
                attachment. Or, if you do not own a stand mixer, a regular large mixing bowl. Heat the milk on the stove or 
                in the microwave until warm to touch, about 110°F (43°C). Pour warm milk on top of yeast/sugar. Whisk gently 
                to combine, then loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes. The mixture will 
                be frothy after 5-10 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                If you do not have a mixer, you can mix by hand in this step. Add the butter, egg, flour, and salt. 
                Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Dough will be soft. Using lightly floured hands, form it into a ball. If 
                the dough is too sticky to handle, add 1-3 more Tablespoons of flour, but you want a very soft dough.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Place the dough in a greased bowl (nonstick spray is fine) and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. 
                Place in a slightly warm environment to rise until doubled in size, around 60-90 minutes. For this warm 
                spot, I suggest using the oven. Preheat to 150°F, then turn the oven off after preheating. Place the covered 
                bowl inside and shut the oven door. This is your warm environment.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Prepare filling: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and prepare your 
                star bread filling. See all options below.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Assemble the bread: Watch the video above to guide you through this step. Punch down the dough to release 
                the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide into 4 equal pieces and, with a floured 
                rolling pin, roll each out into a thin 10-inch circle. Place the bottom circle on prepared baking sheet. 
                If it lost its circle shape, use your hands to form the edges back into a round shape. Top with filling, 
                then layer the remaining circles and filling on top. The top layer does not have filling on it, so only 3 
                of the 4 circles will be topped with filling. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut any scraps around 
                the edges so you have an even circle. Place a 3 inch round object or bowl in the center and make an indent. 
                This is the center of the star. Now it’s time to cut strips from the edge to the center 3-inch circle. 
                Using a pizza cutter, cut 16 even strips. Using both hands, grab two strips and twist them away from each 
                other twice, then press the two ends together to make a point. Your star bread will have 8 points.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Cover the shaped bread with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and let it rest for 20 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Bake the bread: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the star bread with egg wash. This ensures a 
                beautifully shiny golden brown bread. Bake for about 25- 30 minutes or until golden brown on top. If you 
                notice the top or points browning too quickly, loosely tent the star bread with aluminum foil. Remove from 
                the oven and cool for 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Dust confectioners’ sugar on top and enjoy warm. Cover and store leftover star bread at room 
                temperature for 1-2 days or in the refrigerator for 4-5 days
            </p>

            <p class="directions">
                If you want to make it ahead: Refrigerate dough for up to 1-2 days or freeze up to 3 months. Prepare bread 
                dough through step 3 below. After it has risen, punch the dough down to release the air bubbles. Cover the 
                dough tightly, then place it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. 
                When ready, thaw the bread overnight in the refrigerator. (If frozen.) Remove the dough from the 
                refrigerator and let it sit on the counter, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Punch the dough down again to 
                release any air bubbles. Then, continue with step 5. I do not recommend shaping the star bread and 
                refrigerating overnight. Letting the shaped bread sit in the refrigerator overnight risks over-rising and 
                losing its shape.
