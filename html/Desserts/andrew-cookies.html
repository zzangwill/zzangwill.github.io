                  1 1/2 tbsp pure vanilla extract
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                  4 large egg whites
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div id="secton2">
            <p class="directions">
               Sift flour, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
               In a medium heavy saucepan, combine chocolate and oil; warm over very low heat, sitrring frequently, until just melted and smooth 
               (be careful that chocolate does not scorch). Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Stir in the brown sugar, corn syrup, and vanilla
               until well blended. Using a whisk, beat egg whites into the chocolate mixture untul no lumps of brown sugar remain. With a spoon, gently
               stir chocolate mixture into dry ingredients just until smooth.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Cover the dough and refrigerate until it becomes firm enough to shape into balls (around 2.5-8 hours). Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly
                oil the baking sheets or line with parchment paper.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Put the remaining 1 cup of powdered sugar into a low bowl. Dust hands with powdered sugar and roll the dough into 1-inch balls with your palms.
                 Roll balls in powdered sugar until heavily coated. Put them on the baking sheet about 1.5 inches apart from one another. Bake for 8-10 minutes
                 or until the tops are almost firm when you tap them. Be careful to not overbake, as they can get very hard (Andrew's mom describes them as
                 hockey pucks). Let them stand for about 2 minutes, 
                 then use a spatula to transfer to a rack to cool. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
