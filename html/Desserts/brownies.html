                <li class="ingredient">
                    10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks, 140 grams) unsalted butter
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1 ¼ cups (250 grams) sugar
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons (80 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch-process)
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    ¼ teaspoon salt 
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    2 cold large eggs
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    ½ cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour
                </li>

                Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F. 
                Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or 
                foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides.
            </p>

            <p class="directions">
                Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa, and salt in a medium heatproof bowl and set the bowl in a 
                wide skillet of barely simmering water. Stir from time to time until the butter is melted 
                and the mixture is hot enough that you want to remove your finger fairly quickly after 
                dipping it in to test. Remove the bowl from the skillet and set aside briefly until the 
                mixture is only warm, not hot.
            </p>

            <p class="directions">
                Stir in the vanilla with a wooden spoon. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously 
                after each one. When the batter looks thick, shiny, and well blended, add the flour and 
                stir until you cannot see it any longer, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes with the 
                wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Stir in the nuts, if using. Spread evenly in the lined 
                pan.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Bake until a toothpick plunged into the center emerges slightly moist with batter, 20 to 25 
                minutes. Let cool completely on a rack.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Lift up the ends of the parchment or foil liner, and transfer the brownies to a 
                cutting board. Cut into 16 or 25 squares.
