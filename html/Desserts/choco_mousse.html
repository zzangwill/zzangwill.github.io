                <li class="ingredient">
                    8 ounces bittersweet chocolate chips, chopped
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    3/4 stick (3 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    3 large eggs, separated
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1 tablespoon Cognac or other brandy (or swap with a liqueur of your choice)
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1 cup very cold heavy or whipping cream
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1/8 teaspoon salt

                Set a large bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and melt the 
                chocolate and butter in it, gently stirring it until smooth. Remove from 
                heat. Alternately, you can melt them in your microwave, stirring thoroughly 
                at 30 seconds and every 15 seconds thereafter until the mixture is smooth.
            </p>

            <p class="directions">
                In the small bowl, beat yolks with your electric mixer until thick enough to 
                form a ribbon that takes a few seconds to dissolve — this will take about two to 
                four minutes to achieve. Whisk yolks into chocolate mixture.
            </p>

            <p class="directions">
               In one of the medium bowls, beat the cream with cleaned beaters until it just 
               holds stiff peaks.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                In the other medium bowl, beat the egg whites and salt with cleaned beaters 
                until they just hold soft peaks.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Fold the whipped cream and beaten whites into the chocolate mixture, gently 
                but thoroughly. Transfer to 8 (4 ounce) ramekins or one large serving bowl, 
                or go restaurant-style, serving it in stemmed glasses with white or dark 
                chocolate shavings on top.
