        <div id="secton2">
            <p class="directions">
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a muffin tin with paper cupcake liners. In a large bowl combine the flour, 3/4 teaspoon salt, baking powder and baking soda. Set aside. 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
              In a large bowl attached to a stand mixer, add the cold butter cubes, brown sugar and white sugar. Mix on low speed until it starts to combine, approximately 30 seconds. Once combined, raise the speed to medium high and cream for approximately 4 minutes. Scrape the bowl and add the egg and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Beat on medium speed until incorporated (about a minute). Gradually add the flour mixture, being sure not to over mix. Stir in 3/4 cup chocolate chips. 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Scoop the dough into 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls (or use a scoop) and place in the center of each muffin tin. Bake for approximately 10 minutes. It should be not quite done in the middle - it will bake again with the filling. Take out of the oven and lightly press on the center of each cookie with a spoon to form a "cup". 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                To make the filling, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder, egg yolks, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Spoon the filling into the indentation of the cups. 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Bake for 10 - 12 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes then transfer the cups to a cooling rack and carefully remove the paper cupcake liners. Allow the cookie cups to cool for approximately 30 minutes then sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips on top with a pinch of salt.  Transfer to the refrigerator to set. The filling should set in 2 - 3 hours
                Store in the refrigerator.
