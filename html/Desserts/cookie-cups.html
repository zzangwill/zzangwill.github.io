            <p>Ganache filling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1/2 cup chocolate chips or finely chopped chocolate
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1 tablespoon butter
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1/4 cup whole milk
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">

        <div id="secton2">
            <p class="directions">
                Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease 24 mini muffin cups well. 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                In a light-colored (so you can observe the browning) skillet, brown the butter: chop up butter and place into skillet over a medium flame. First, the butter will melt. Once butter melts, it will foam and bubble. Make sure to stir the butter periodically with a rubber spatula. After a few minutes, the bubbling will subside and golden specks will appear on the bottom of the pan and the butter will start smelling nutty. This means your butter is browned! Warning: butter should have golden/amber specks, not completely brown ones. If the butter is too browned, your cookie cups may have a burnt/bitter taste.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Remove skillet from flame right away and pour the browned butter into a large mixing bowl to stop the cooking. Make sure to scrape in all the browned specks from the bottom of the pan. Stir the brown sugar into the browned butter. Next, whisk in the egg and vanilla extract vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt over wet ingredients and mix everything together until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips last.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Round medium pieces of dough between palms and press them down into the muffin molds. Bake cookie cups for 8-9 minutes, until the edges are just golden and the centers are barely set. 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                While cookie cups are baking, prepare chocolate filling: Combine chocolate chips and butter in a small bowl. Heat the milk until just boiled. Pour hot milk over the chocolate and let mixture sit for a couple minutes before stirring until the chocolate is melted. Stir in the vanilla extract. Set aside. 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                While cookie cups are still hot, using a small shot glass, press halfway down into the center of each cookie cup, forming indent for the chocolate filling. Remove cookie cups from their molds. Drop a spoonful of chocolate ganache into each cookie cup, filling to the top. After a while, the filling will thicken somewhat but will not harden fully.
