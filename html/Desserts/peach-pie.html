                </li>

            <p class="directions">
                For crust: Blend flour, sugar, and salt in a processor. Add butter and shortening; cut in using on/off turns until fat is reduced to pea-sized pieces, about 25 turns. Using on/off turns, blend in 3/4 cup buttermilk until dough just comes together in moist clumps, adding more buttermilk if the dough is dry. Gather the dough into a ball, and divide it into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other. Flatten each into a disk. Wrap the disks in plastic, and chill at least 1 hour or overnight.
            </p>

            <p class="directions">
               For filling: Mix 3/4 cup of sugar and the next 4 ingredients in al arge bowl. Cook the peaches in a pot of boiling water for 30 seconds, then transfer them into a bowl of cold water. Let cool, then peel, halve, and pit the peaches. Slice the peaches into a bowl with the sugar mixture; toss to coat. Let the filling stand until juices form, stirring often, about 20 minutes.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Place 1 rack in teh center of an oven and 1 rack at the lowest position. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Roll our the larger dough disk on floured surface to 12-13 inches round. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch diameter glass pie dish. Trim the overhang to 3/4 inches. Mound the filling in the center of the dish, dot it with butter. Roll out the second disk on a floured surface to 12-inches round. Gently roll up the dough onto a rolling pin, drap the dough over the filling. Pinch the overhang and edge of the top crust together. Fold the edge under. Cut several slits in the top crust. Crimp the edge. Brush the pie with a beaten egg, and sprinkle with 1 tablespooon of sugar.
            </p>

            <p class="directions"> 
                Place the pie on the center rack in the oven. Bake for 50 minutes. Place a baking sheet on the lowest rack to catch drippings. Continue to bake the pie until the crust is brown and the juices bubble thickly through the slits, covering very loosely with foil if the top browns too quickly, about 20 minutes. Cool on a rack for 1 hour, serve warm or at room temperature.
