                <li class="ingredient">

                </li>
            </ul>

        <div id="secton2">
            <p class="directions">
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-count muffin pan, and a second one with 4 lined.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Make the crust: mix the cookie crumbs, sugar, and butter together in a medium bowl until combined. The mixture 
                will b e thick, coarse, and sandy. Press a heaping tablespoon of mixture down into each liner, making sure the 
                crust is tight and compact. You might have a little crust leftover. If so, press a little more into each liner - 
                if desired! Prebake the crusts for 5 minutes. Remove from teh oven and set aside.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Make the filling: in a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the cream cehese on high speed 
                until completely smooth (about 1 minute). On a medium-high speed, beat in pumpkin, egg, and egg yolk, scraping down sides 
                of the bowl as needed. On high speed, beat in sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin spice, and vanilla until combined.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Pour the filling evenly into each crust. Bake until centers only slightly jiggle, 18-20 minutesl Let the cheesecake cool 
                at room temperature in the pan set on a wire rack. Once completely cool, place cheesecakes in the fridge for at least 2 
                hours or overnight. The cheesecakes will slightly sink in the middle - that's okay!
            </p>

            <p class="directions">
                Once chilled, drizzle each with salted caramel sauce and garnish with pecans. Store leftovers covered tightly in 
                the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
