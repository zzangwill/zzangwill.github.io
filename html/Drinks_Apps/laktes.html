                    5 potatoes

                <li class="ingredient">
                   1 onion

                    3 eggs

                <li class="ingredient">
                    1/2 cup flour

                Grate potatoes (by hand). Drain as much liquid as possible. Grate onions and add to potatoe
                mixture. Add eggs and mix everything together. Add salt and pepper to taste, along with flour 
                until the ideal consistency is met. Only the ancestors can tell you what that is.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Press about a golfball size in a scoop, press down to remove liquid and make it into a patty
                shape. Put into a pan with hot oil (preferable olive), and allow to cook until it freely moves
                with a little nudge. Wait until the edges look slightly brown, and flip with a fork by stabbing 
                the side. Do not force the flip. Cook until the bottom gets a nice golden brown. Continue to 
                flip and cook until it is as crispy as you want. Try not to overflip, however. Let the potato rest.
