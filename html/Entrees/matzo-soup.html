                <li class="ingredient">

                   1 onion, diced
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1 head of whole garlic cloves
                 </li>
                 <li class="ingredient">
                    Lots of whole fresh parsley
                 </li>
                 <li class="ingredient">
                    1 tbsp Osem soup flavoring
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                   1 Manischewitz Matzo Ball Soup Mix
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    Tons of Hawaij
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div id="secton2">
            <p class="directions">
                Put a whole 8-piece chicken in a large pot with water. Bring to boil, skimming off the schmaltz that will gather on the top. 
                (Schmaltz is a foamy-like fatty substance that appears on the rim.) Stop when the foam stops forming on the top of the soup.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                While the chicken boils/cooks, chop up one turnip, one rutabaga, two to three large carrots, and one onion (just depends on preference). 
                Add these to the pot along with whole garlic cloves. Add Osem chicken soup seasoning (to taste), about one tablespoon. 
                Note this adds a good amount of salt to the soup. For richer flavor, you can use chicken/bone broth for the base soup as well. 
                If you do this, add less water in the beginning as this will add volume.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Use Manischewitz matzo ball soup mix to make matzo balls (follow its instructions) and add the soup mix to the pot. 
                Add tons of Hawaij (turmeric-like spice from Israel). Must be Hawaij MARAK (marak = soup). Add in lots of whole parsley.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Note on adding matzo balls to soup: they take time to absorb the soup into the ball, but also get mushier as they sit in the liquid longer. 
                So, add them whenever you decide, weighing these factors.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Optional: after a long time of simmering on low boil, remove the chicken and de-bone so you do not have to deal with that while eating. 
                I do this by shredding it with two forks so I do not have to touch the boiling hot chicken. 
                My mom does this by hand, burning her fingers.
