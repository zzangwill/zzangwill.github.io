<p> Scythe by Neal Shusterman - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I believe this is the best book I've read this year so far. Shusterman takes the idea of immortality's shepherd and turns it into a book about morals, ethics, absurdim, nihilism, the meaning of life, religion, philosophy, and the purpose as well as the definition of humanity.

    He did this all the while creating a world so visceral and detailed, my reality continuously dissipated whenever I opened the book. Every character stands as their own, and even when they are shrouded in mystery or celebrity, who they are and their benefit to the story is evident.

    A true testament to Neal's storytelling writing, I believe, is how even I began to be convinced by the main antagonist's teaching, even as I knew they were in the wrong -- just as the protagonist knew as they were swayed by his ways. It is disturbing to feel this way, and to go on the same journey of misgivings and internal conflicts as a character makes their journey and struggle all the more authentic and heart-wrenching. I would like to offer spoiler-free quotes of phrases that irritated me with the sense it made:

    "Gleanings should be iconic. They should be memorable....That is after all, why we scythes are here. To keep us connected to our past....<b>For those who will be gleaned, do we not, at the very least, owe them a spectacular end?"</b>

    or:

    "Rightmindedness is overrated. I'd rather have a mind that's clear than one that's right."

    One can disagree, but at the very least, you can understand where this is coming from. Which hurts me to say.

    On the topic of quotes, I ended up tabbing many pages with phrases I wished to save - something I have never done before in a book. I've had the desire, but I have never followed through. This is another testament to Neal's writing. I will share only one more quote to save the amazing writing for others to discover:

    "I love the way it rains here. It reminds me that some forces of nature can never be entirely subdued. <b>They are eternal, which is a far better thing to be than immortal."</b>

    Circling back to the subject of themes, this book made me stop and pause on multiple occasions to ruminate on my future career path. This was kind of ironic, since the world in Scythe is one that does not need healthcare or medicine (except perhaps in the area of reviving). Diseases are eradicated, aging is a non-issue, physical injuries are not fatal. Yet I ruminate on medicine, and how it relates to the Scythes. Both are sometimes compared to god, or taking part in acts of god, even if they are opposites in execution. One can also argue both submit the person to pain, suffering, and personal sacrifice for the profession. Loss and strain are ever-present. Those with the true desire to better humanity should be the ones chosen and allowed to progress in their studies, and have in their hands the capability to alter lives. But we can never know who this progression will change a person, and this scares me. How could it not? I have other thoughts I seem incapable of articulating regarding this topic, but it does not matter since I am not even discussing the book anymore, haha. I should get back to the actual subject.

    In essence, I thought this book a masterpiece. I find myself guessing twists frequently, and Shusterman managed to surprise me on several occasions even while I was dazing in and out as I had an internal philosophical discussion prompted by his story. Incredible, 5/5 stars given, and I would give more if I could.

<p> The Rook by Daniel O'Malley - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Enjoyable read. Interesting debate regarding what makes a human, the body, soul, mind, or memories, etc. Is Rook Thomas two people? Or is she just finally breaching her potential?

    Anyways, probably would have given a higher score if not for the large portion of exposition at the end of the novel explaining many plot points. And the pages and pages of italic chapters. And sometimes distinct thoughts or observations made by the main character that I had to wonder if a woman would actually make those observations or have those thoughts. Still, as I said, it was a fun read.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Thunderhead by Neal Shusterman - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fantastic continuation of book one. The pace may be slower, but the payoff is immense. Small details come back to play big parts in the climactic ending, and while I guessed the big reveals, Shusterman proved his ability to hide twists within twists as I was still surprised by many turn of events in his book. Can’t wait for the finale.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Toll by Neal Shusterman - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A phenomenal ending for an invigorating series. I would call it perfect, but that has a connotation that comes across as false.

    Instead, Neal Shusterman's intricate weaving of and merging of story lines that were seeded from book one come to fruition in an intense cacophony of events. When I mention perfection, it is in the sense that a perfect ending would seem artificial and unrewarding. The perfect ending stemmed from a series of choices by characters and developments that many times left an unpalatable impression, as they were imperfect. However by the end, you turn the final page with a sense of fulfillment and contentment. That is how one achieves the perfect ending.

    Truly unbelievable series, 10/10!

<p> Lightlark by Alex Aster - 1/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Warning: this is probably my longest review to date, and while there are not plot-related spoilers, I am using many quotes from throughout the book in examples for my review so you have been warned.

Like many readers of Lightlark, I first heard about the book from Alex Aster’s own promotional TikTok video asking the internet “would you read a book about” which then gave us a Pinterest montage of this book. Intrigued, I preordered Lightlark, and was excited for when I could finally read it.

Like many readers, a week before Lightlark came out, I was bombarded with videos both defending and attacking the book. In a distasteful turn of events, I witnessed people reviewing Lightlark before it came out, regardless of their status as ARC recipients. At this point, my excitement turned into anxiety, and I discovered I could not cancel my preorder. However, I decided I should read the book myself, and make my own choices. The internet was influencing my perception of the book before I even gave it a chance! At least I should have my own impression, after actually reading it.

We have now arrived at that moment. I have finished Lightlark, and have decided it was one of the most poorly edited, plotted, and fleshed-out books I have read this year.

To be objective, I am discarding all previous notions I may have had about the novel based on what people were saying online. Promised scenes? I did not hear about those. Intended tropes? Whatever I read, that is all I know about. Even still, my problems with the book began almost as soon as I started reading, and they never left.

First, the writing was not up to par to anything I expected. Yes, this is YA, but even it was on the younger side of YA (which considering its content and themes it shouldn’t be), the writing would still be underperforming. Full disclosure, I am not professional book editor (surprise!) but as someone who has been reading for about two decades now (which is almost my whole life), I think my opinion does hold some water. Here are many examples of poor writing that stood out to me, and they are only a sampling of the many more the book contains. Some, I may even offer slight revisions so they feel better to me. Not expert changes, just a few little mindless tweaks.

- “Singing was a Wildling thing, a temptress thing.”
This was already the second time Aster decided to use “thing” as a descriptor, very early on in the book.

- “Isla’s grin was a primal thing”
Thing again! Why not say “Isla had a primal grin”?

- “The red wrapped breathtakingly tightly”
Two adverbs in a row! Brave.

- “she said steadily”
I don’t even know what this means.

- “Azul said heartily”

- “He hadn’t said it meanly, more matter-of-factly”
Another brave use of adverbs. What about “He had not said it to be mean, just a matter of fact.”

- “he walked assuredly”

- “She said meanly”
People say many things meanly, also many things sternly, or steadily.

- “She grinned meanly”
I guess they grin meanly too.

- “She fell, fell, fell”
I did not take a photo of the first time Aster uses repetition to her disadvantage, but it showed up again here, and it took all of my willpower not to give myself a facepalm.

Now, these are all word choices that bothered me when I read. Aster’s style also felt childish. Multiple paragraph breaks, multiple incomplete sentences (which I know works in books some times, but when it is over and over, and misused, it does not work), overused italics, etc, just made the books feel under edited.

“She was empty.

Hollow.

Celeste. Her best and only friend.”

“Her fingers wrapped around something the was buzzing faintly. Glowing.”

“...able to sense her terror throughout the Centennial. Her confusion. Still. That was no excuse.”

I just don’t see the point of all the periods. “...able to sense her terror throughout the Centennial, her confusion. Still, that was no excuse” flows a lot better, in my opinion.

“When her breath returned, she stood, looking around at the bodies that never would again.

Dead. They were all dead.”

Reading it, it just… feels, pardon the pun, lifeless. Isla never gives anything, her personality is snuffed out by the stagnant writing.

“But if Oro died…

All of Lightlark would.”

“There was a bridge. It was broken in many places. The sides were made of braided vines.”

I think you get the point. The abundance and overuse of adverbs was shocking. The bursts of short sentences on literally every page is staggering and elementary writing at best. Aster is an award-winning author, according to her author blurb at the end of the book, but I cannot see why.

Okay. Now we are on the second point.

Writing aside, sometimes books make up for a lack in that area with a beautifully crafted world, lore, and people. This was not the case with Lightlark. In fantasy, obviously we can suspend reality all the time, but even with a pitch as simple as “six realms fighting to break a curse” was made into a story that did not really make much sense. The only motivation for many characters was not dying. It’s a good one, but not super compelling when most books in the fantasy genre have that (and more) on the line. And when death is on the line, usually it is to a greater degree. I never really felt that Isla was in much danger, despite Aster trying to convince us readers that she was. True, she almost died a few times, but it was not dramatic nor worrying.

Next, the characters. As I mentioned, I felt as though Isla’s personality did not come through. She was wishy washy with her loyalty, her feelings came and went without much reason, and she was an expert in everything but wielding supernatural powers since she trained her whole life for this! Except, so had all the other characters, who were all centuries older than her, and somehow worse at those things Isla excelled in. Oh, and did we mention she’s of course the most beautiful thing on Lightlark? Because of course she is.

The other characters were similarly flat, only ever being defined by one or two personality traits. Celeste is kind and forgiving. Grim is secretive and brooding. King Oro’s trait (for the most part) is that he has none. God, it just got boring so quickly.

Aster herself seems to get confused by her story since towards the end, when Oro uses a magical ability in the climax of a scene, Isla is surprised to see him able to what he is doing, in the sense that what he was doing was unheard of. Despite the fact, several chapters before, this ability was established.

For my final gripe (biggest spoiler warning here), the big reveal involving the sun and an egg — the main character was astounded, because my goodness! “How many times had she thought that the full moon looked like an egg? That the sun looked yolky?” I don’t know, maybe millions of times like every other human being that has looked as the sun or moon and has seen an egg or an egg yolk? It was not ground breaking. But even still, I would never personally describe the sun as “just a yolky thing” (chapter three). I would think, dang, the sun kinda looks like an egg yolk.

Phew. That was a lot, especially for me. As you can see, in my eyes, this book is a 1/5 stars. I don’t really see any redeeming qualities. The book is written for elementary levels, but the romance and death themes are not suited for that, so I find this book does not have a place at all. Aster lamented that this book suffered a decade of rejection. I believe that rejection was all founded on some very good reasons.

However, I am taking this all as a lesson. Just like that fake dog pet toy I begged my parents to buy for me from ToysRUs around 18 years ago after seeing a compelling commercial on TV that I ended up hating due to it being, well, terrible, Lightlark is my new hubris courtesy of BookTok. Never again will I preorder a first installation of a book series, and never again will I be swayed by the hive mind to obsess over an idea before seeing the product.

Nonetheless, I am happy I found this out for myself, and I hope this review helps others.
