<p> One Dark Window by Rachel Gillig - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Even if it’s a bit predictable, this world and its magic is so engrossing I consumed this book within 24 hours. The ending is brilliant, and I loved it since I’m a sucker for a female protagonist going feral for retribution. Can’t wait for the sequel.

<p> The Book Eaters by Sunyi Dean - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    After reading this book I have decided it is really less about Book Eaters themselves -- although their lore and beliefs are fascinating -- and more about the human (or rather, sentient being) experience. Devon, our protagonist, is hard to characterize. She literally fed false beliefs, indoctrinated from the moment she was birthed, and many times over the years has her world turned over its head as she realizes this.

    This book raises the questions of what makes a good person, and what choices we make to save those we love. But the most important debate, I think, is how anyone can change a system. Is this change even possible? What about when the system is set up for survival? Is it okay to change it, if it means the destruction of others? Do people only see the other side when they are negatively affected? I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I am grateful for them being brought up.

<p> Belladonna by  Adalyn Grace - 3-4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Part murder mystery, part paranormal romance, part period piece. I have some hesitations about Death and Signa's relationship with Death, but that notwithstanding, I enjoyed this book immensely. Signa, and Blythe in particular, and thoroughly enjoyable female protagonists trying to navigate a world that demands a lot from women in the form of them achieving little. I did not anticipate the several of the twists at the end, although the motivations for the final reveal left me wanting. The blatant set-up for another novel had a comedic feel to it, and I am not sure if that was intentional or not.
