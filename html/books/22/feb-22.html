<p> The Candle and the Flame by Nafiza Azad - 2/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I am conflicted about this book. I tore through its entirety in a single day, and yet as I turned the last page, I felt an immense sense of dissatisfaction.

  I must admit I do not know a lot about Islamic culture, which plays a big part in my desire to reach a Muslim fantasy such as this. I want to learn more, expand my knowledge of a world I know little about. And The Candle and the Flame certainly does this by leaps and bounds. The author spends ample time describing clothes, homes, and delicious food in almost every chapter. I certainly felt immersed in the world. However, even a world as colorful as Noor, the city this book takes place, feels like an empty canvas when characters cannot make their presence known. I believe this is why I was unappeased.

  At first I felt like the characters were introduced in a strong manner. But as the story progressed, I realized more and more the vast cast of characters flattened out. What I had viewed as complex was simple, and when I expected something new, I got more of the same again and again. One trait defines most characters: the princess is in love with the Emir; the Emir is protective; the prince is just a disgusting human; there are many more examples. Yes, the main protagonist undergoes a major change (spoilers prevent me from saying exactly what). But after this change, she somehow becomes more subdued even in her newfound bravery and strength. Worst of all, for somehow who just received such power, she lets the story carry her everywhere.

  This is my biggest trifle with the book. I paraphrase, but somewhere in the book Fatima Ghalaza says “there is no choice”. This is true for anything she does in the novel. Everything she does is not by her own volition; it is because something happens to her, someone demands something of her, or something happens to her loved one. For a book that gives so much attention to having women take control of their lives, I found Fatima having not much of her own. I can think of two instances she actually makes a big choice for herself.

  The plot, in my opinion, was easily anticipated from the beginning. Traitors were obvious, the romance was expected from the second the couple bumps into one another, and the resolution seemed anticlimactic. I kept thinking, “surely this cannot be it?” in regards to many “exciting” plot points. But nope, that was it, and the plot moved onward without any fanfare.

  I want to take a moment to reflect on aspects of the book I appreciated. As mentioned, the strong theme of women empowerment is amazing. Also as mentioned, the detailed world which the characters live in is rich and makes me want to visit Noor. While the Maharaja’s sister bothered me most of the book, at the end, I liked her decision-making.

  However. I do acknowledge that I am not the target audience. This book, to the T, is a young young adult book in terms of tropes and a simple storyline. I think, if I had read this a decade ago, I might have eaten this novel up with joy. But reading it now, I find the potential enormous, but execution missing.

<p> The Coward by Stephen Aryan - 3/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Not the most amazing book, but a decent book. That is my final impression.

  The Coward gives off a very Odyssey-like quality to it, with almost the entirety of the book being committed to the journey. Ride on horses, arrive at another town, drink at the inn, and repeat the next day. Every day, fight a new enemy relentlessly.

  Other chapter POVs were mixed in, giving the impression of a greater story line culminating, but the culmination will definitely happen in later books in the series. Due to the jumping around, it was hard to feel attached to the other "main" characters, since not a large amount of time could be fully given to create a sense of empathy for these characters. However, I was indeed convinced by their motivations.

  Unfortunately, I felt that many of the characters were one or possibly two dimensional. What was clearly supposed to be a twist for some characters was expected. Other characters remained completely unchanged. The child protagonist was irritating at times, since he played in the child-like role so well. Kell, the main protagonist, does undergo character development, and he is the most important person who requires the development, so that is a good thing.

  The world-building has been clearly planned out, but sometimes it was hard to follow along with all the names of the Kings, kingdoms, and other civilizations. But the world itself is intriguing.

  Lastly, this is another book that ruins itself for me by placing a lot of exposition at the end. The main character gets told a lot of information that would have felt more rewarding had it been delivered a different way. Again, it felt like this was setting up the next book.

  I did love the premise, of a hero who would rather be anything but. And Kell was a nice character to have narrate.

  Overall, this book is a decent setup for the rest of the story to unfold in subsequent novels.

<p> Graceling (graphic novel) by Kristin Cashore - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A beautiful rendition of the Graceling written novel. You can tell with certainty the artist and adapter cared about the source material. The characters are designed eerily as I imagined them in my head, scenes are taken from the page verbatim, and a love is given to the environment around the characters that makes you feel you are living in the Seven Kingdoms.

    Obviously some scenes from the novel are missing, but that is to be expected with a graphic novel rendition. Without these scenes, the story progresses fluently and the characters are still given ample time to progress and grow. I seriously have no qualms about this graphic novel. Anyone who adored Graceling (and enjoys graphic novels) will fall in love with Gareth Hinds' creation. I would 100% recommend it. (Although I would recommend reading the source material first!)

    10/10.

<p> Howl's Moving Castle my Diana Wynn Jones - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I watched the movie before reading the book. In comparison to the movie adaptation, Sophie is more stubborn and strong-headed, Howl is more dramatic, the Witch of the Waste is more evil, and the ending is more surprising. And I absolutely loved it. I’ll just include the obligatory “the movie is great as a movie version and the book is great for a book version” but even if I hadn’t seen the movie, I would have enjoyed this book immensely.

  The world is fun to dive into, the connections to our own world is clever, and all the story lines weaving together keeps the mind active while reading. The characters are all well molded with their own flaws and strengths, and each have personalities that make them all shine out as individuals.

  Quite a joy to read. 5/5.
