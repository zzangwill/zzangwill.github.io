<p> Age of Assassins by RJ Barker - 2/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    This will be one of my first times actually writing a review, and this is because I was just simply astonished by what I read. When I first picked this book up, I was excited -- assassin, fantasy, undercover -- it seemed right up my alley of what I enjoyed reading.

    However, soon after beginning, I picked up on a few edit errors. Most books I read have at least one or two, so I let it slide. Then quickly I spotted another. Then another. And again. Thus, I began marking a note for every error I found. These included a lack of final punctuation, an extra question mark, missing open or closing quotation marks, capitalization in incorrect parts of a sentence. Overall, I tallied 18 errors (plus or minus 1 or 2, depending on if you count inconsistency between how the author types the my-master counting as an error). Out of 393 pages, that is an error about every 21.8 pages. This is what astonished me. How could so many errors, that appeared apparent to me, make it to publishing? Perhaps because it seems this is the author's first publication, but still, it removed me from the book's story.

    As for the story, since I would never give a book a low score simply because of its editorial issues, I will comment on the actual contents. This book did contain redeeming qualities. The idea of using an assassin to stop an assassin intrigued me -- profession versus profession, trying to outwit the other, is very interesting. I did enjoy the characters, each with distinguished personalities and charming sarcasm. But again, I personally had several issues.

    To me, this book felt very tell, not show. The main narrator would spell out clearly what was already understood from context with his inner thoughts. Sometimes, he would outright repeat his own thoughts to another character. Furthermore, lines would also be reused. If this was stylistic choice to reinforce the thought or if it was an oversight, I will never know. But the the two examples that come to mind is when Girton realizes the blacksmith is a fool, and I believe it is Heamus that repeats this a page or two later, or when some guards remark "Who has the mounts wins the fight", and then Girton's master says that as well a page or two later.

    Remarking on telling not showing, my greatest disappointment was how the unveiling of the mystery came about in eight pages of pure exposition. Yes, the main character helped find clues, but the master had to spell every detail out right at the end.

  On smaller notes, the minor romance felt rushed and unrealistic to me, but perhaps that was a result of the main character finally living a "normal" life for the first time. Which was an aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed, seeing how Girton tried to live a regular person's life while behaving as an assassin. But honestly, I simply kept feeling like I was reading a filtered version of "Assassin's Apprentice" by Robin Hobb. Fitz had a more tangible journey, perhaps since it was longer than a few weeks.

  Overall, I forced myself to finish reading this book simply to find out how many errors it contained - I did not read it for the lackluster plot. Maybe these aspects of the book improve later on in the series, but I will not be continuing my journey through the Wounded Kingdom.
