<p> A Magic Steeped in Poison - 3-4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A Magic Steeped in Poison thrives off its connection to history, culture, and mythology. The richness of the story comes from the immensely detailed descriptions of gods, food, and tea making practices. Every bit of knowledge that Judy Lin offered, I eagerly read.

    However, this debut falters at a few points for me. Most characters, while they had strong personalities, came across as one-dimensional to me. The main character, Ning, has the great trait of not holding back the truth, which influences a lot of the book in great ways. However, she does not offer much else besides this (personality-wise -- she does offer other things), despite the story's themes of deception and hidden loyalties.

    The love interest was golden-retriever like, and yes has an interesting upbringing, but it doesn't affect how he treats the main character that much. And the love connection itself seemed too instant, too much of "first male handsome character I talk to", and to me, gave too much power over the main character. When they first meet, I thought she was on a time crunch, but then she goes about leisurely with the love interest? That confused me.

    Other characters as well were one-dimensional, even if I liked them. The most complex character, in my opinion, is the antagonist, the General -- and I hope to learn/see more of him in the sequel.

    Another fault is that some scenes felt off to me, either not really moving the plot along, or purely for a forced plot development later. That combination rests uneasily in me.

    I will say, despite that, the magic system!! So cool. I think that is everyone's verdict, to be fair. Seriously, so unique, and so cool. And like I said, the history, culture, and mythology make the kingdom of Daxi leap off the pages. I 100% will read the next book!

<p> Iron Widow by Xiran Jay Zhao - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The ferocity and fire coming from these pages is undeniable, and I must admit it is satisfying and gratifying to read a book with a woman as vicious, unyielding, and unapologetic as Zetian is.

    The writing style is unique and felt fresh to me, and is a perfect match to the main character’s personality. The mecha fighting is fun even in a world as terrible as the one depicted.

    The world — something lacking for me from Iron Widow is the world. There is a good amount of current-time world building, but it seemed more like a framework than fleshed out. I believe this is due to the twist at the end, and I hope that the next book dives more into the intriguing world.

    Secondly, is while the themes, points, and motifs are important and strong, to me, while superficial does not feel like the correct choice, they weren’t as dynamic, I suppose. Capitalism, glorification of the military, propaganda, mental vs physical strength, and misogyny are important topics (and there are more in the novel) to cover, and I appreciate what was covered in the novel, and again I hope in the next the themes are greater expanded upon and develop even more complexity.

    A word on the twist aforementioned (minor spoiler): some compared it to Ender’s Game’s twist, and while I see similarities, I think this twist is fundamentally different as in Ender’s Game us as the reader where so completely gaslight along with Ender by the government that the twist was mind-shattering, while here in Iron Widow Zetian has a deeply rooted loathing and distrust of the government that throughout the novel (in what I believe to be the authors intention) we, the reader, along with Zetian notice things that seem off or do not make sense in the schema, so the twist ends up being more “wow — but that makes sense”. This is not bad, in fact it’s good for Iron Widow. But I believe this is a significant difference that creates a distinct effect.

    TLDR: Iron Widow is a fun, thought provoking read, even as Zetian rages from the book. Vibes would match if you made a smoothie of Hunger Games, Ender’s Game, Pacific Rim, and Poppy War.
