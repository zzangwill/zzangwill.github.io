<p> Prince of Throns by Mark Lawrence - 2-3/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    2-3 stars, I’m kind of torn.

  From reading several other reviews, I don’t think anything I’m about to type is an original thought so I’ll (try to) keep it short.

  I read this book since I was desiring a book with a dark protagonist. Boy, did the author deliver on that front. I don’t think “dark” accurately describes Jorg — he’s cruel, twisted, and obsessive. Therefore, props on that front.

  Further props on an interesting world. The twist revealed I didn’t find shocking, it instead allowed pieces to come together the author had planted.

  I also enjoyed the authors writing style, as well as a nice selection of one-liners that stood out as very poetic.

  Downfalls:
  Yay more sexual violence (rape) against women (and regular violence)
  Yay kill off the token black man that never even gets a name.
  Yay 14 year old that someone exerts his dominance over a group of older men with a level of emotional, intellectual, and sexual maturity, that to me, makes no sense for him to possess.

  For me, the cons weight heavier than the pros, therefore I am at a 2-3/5 but not truly settled on which. From reading reviews, I am unsure on if I will read the sequel, but I am definitely not counting it out as a possibility in the future.
