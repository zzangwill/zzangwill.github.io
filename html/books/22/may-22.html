<p> All my Rage by Sabaa Tahir - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When the back quote stated "This isn't the Sabaa you know, but it's the Sabaa you need to know" I braced myself for an impact. But nothing could have prepared me enough for this book.

    Sabaa does not hold back a single moment in this novel. All the emotions you can imagine, you will feel when reading this book, and yes, rage is indeed one of them. Rage towards the characters, for the characters... for Sabaa for putting me through this. This feeling of rage is important, though, as the novel teaches us -- the story Sabaa tells is one that needs to be heard, and she does it the most heartbreaking, beautiful way.
    
    The warnings for this book are serious, and should be taken as such. However if you are able to read this book, the lessons it will teach you will carry with you for the rest of your life.

<p> The Boy With Fire by Aparna Verma - 3.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Perhaps 3.5 stars, but I'm on the edge.

    I picked this book up a few times and attempted to read it, and couldn't find myself becoming committed. However, I blamed it on a personal reading slump, and tried once more. I reaped nice rewards for this extra chance. Indeed reminding me of the deep connection the people have in Dune to the sands, The Boy With Fire offers its own deep lore involving worshiping of the sun and dunes in harsh, merciless environments.

    I loved this world-building. I felt the fortitude a people of the desert would develop. I felt the rage Elena carries from a traumatic past and upbringing. I felt Yessen being pulled every direction. I felt Leo been torn apart be the decisions he made in the name of family and kingdom. Similar to Poppy Wars, another book this one is compared to, the severity of the Phoenix and the hunger it emits is very powerful. Playing with religion, specifically when its existence is so tangible, always interests me.

    About 3/4ths of the way through the book, there was a turning point for me. The pace picked up, which at first made sense, but near the end of the book I did not follow the speed. Specifically (SPOILER) when the main character and love interest got together, I felt it unwarranted and rushed. Elena's oscillating between good and evil made sense, but the way it progressed did not. Were the mines truly that important? Did she not understand the risk? Why did Yassen throw all this training out the window just when Elena bats her eyes? This inconsistency is what drops the rating in my opinion.

    While these questions irked me, the twists closer to the very end kept the story fresh, and as I closed the book I was very satisfied with the story. Can't wait to see how the war develops.
