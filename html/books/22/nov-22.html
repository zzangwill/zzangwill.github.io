<p> Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Su Lynn Tan - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Amazing debut, beautiful world and a fantastic main character. I also love that the tension/conflict never rose from a lack of communication or miscommunication - that was refreshing.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> This is How You Lose the Time War - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A very interesting novel, but I feel like it keeps the reader at a large distance with a lot of abstracts and hand-wavy “science fiction” and relies heavily on just blue and red’s emotions. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing but the emotions were not strong enough to make it a 5 for me. But the beauty of their situation and the intrigue of the Garden vs the Agency definitely makes it a 4/5.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Blood of the Lotus by Saide Louise - 3-4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Sade Louise's debut novel exhibits a brilliantly spun story -- a mix of Supernatural, Lucifer, and X-Men. But while the premise and mystery keeps your interest piqued, and Lousie's writing conjures up great imagery, the lack of cleanliness that comes with indie publication is noticeable. The pacing, some punctuation plights, arrangement of the story (ie the first chapter being cut by 9 chapters in between until we get back to that moment), and some dialogue might have used some polishing. And while some reactions characters had after ley discounted may have been warranted, I did not feel a deep enough attachment to feel the pain as I possible could have been with more prior development. However! This does not discount the book Louise wrote that I consumed in two days. Ripe with clearly thought-out, deep lore, rich diversity, and great character relationships, I cannot wait for when the next in the series is released!

<p> Heart of the Sun Warrior by Sue Lynn Tan - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>Heart of the Sun Warrior</i> is a dramatic continuation of the tensions that rose in <i>Daughter of the Moon Goddess</i>. It answers questions and hints from the first set in the duology, while adding more to the greater world of the Immortal Realm.

    Compared to <i>Daughter of the Moon Goddess</i>, the action and conflict is not weaved as delicately. When before the betrayal of Wenzhi is shocking and heart-wrenching, the reveal of the “big bad” this time is obvious, and his reasonings just the same. The attempt to make his motivating sympathetic fall flat, and the path to resolution is not complex in the slightest.

    Yet <i>Heart of the Sun Warrior</i>, at its core, is a book about relationships. The drive and main focus throughout this sequel is Xingyin’s deep desire to have her family whole and her inner turmoil dealing with the aftermath of <i>Daughter of the Moon Goddess</i>. The way Sue Lynn Tan progresses through Xingyin’s healing is wonderfully done, always letting us feel Xingyin’s pain intensely. And again, as in the first novel, Sue Lynn Tan does not ride on several miscommunications to move plot forward — characters have honest, open conversations with one another about their feelings and turmoil. Again, this was super refreshing.

    I have to also say, Sue Lynn Tan really tore my heart out, stomped at it, and then proceeded to almost put it back together at the last 15% or so of the book. She’s very cruel, but the ending felt like the right conclusion to Xingyin’s journey.

    5/5 for amazing characters and relationship-driven plot; political/adventure-wise, this is not complex at all, but still a fun journey. Beautiful writing too.

<p>  Red Rising by Pierce Brown - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    TBA
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Merciful Crow by Margaret Owen - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Notes: Detailed, intricate, thought-out world-building and lore. Always fascinating to learn about the kingdom dynamics and caste system. Unique magic system. Complex, interesting main female protagonist. Non-convincing romantic subplot (with a grand total of 1.5 month timeline)
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Golden Son by Pierce Brown - 3/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
   TBA
