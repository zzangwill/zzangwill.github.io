<p> Warcross by Marie Lu - 2/5 stars</p>



<p> Wildcard by Marie Lu - 2/5 stars</p>


<p> Spin the Dawn by Elizabeth Lim - 3/5 stars</p>

<p> The Light of the Midnight Stars by Rena Rossner - ?/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    This is the first book I have ever read that tells a story from the perspective of my history -- the Jewish experience. And boy, now I understand how others felt when they finally saw themselves represented in media. While reading the thoughts and emotions of the characters, I understood them, viscerally felt them, in a way I had never felt with other characters in the past. So thank you, Rena Rossner, for accurately reflecting the Jewish experience.

    I cannot rightfully give this book any star rating, though, since I am biased from my appreciation of representation. While she writes with excellent skills of the craft, I never felt attached to the characters, despite understanding them so well. The story moved so quickly --one "romantic" exploit to the next-- it was hard to enjoy any one character.

    Furthermore, after reading the Author's Note, I understand she had all of these stories in mind she wanted to integrate. I feel like she should have focused on her own story more, rather than forcing in tales without a seamless weave.

    Regardless, the lessons in The Light of the Midnight stars are endless, and it is a worthwhile read.

<p>  Unravel the Dusk by Elizabeth Lim - 2/5 stars</p>

<p> The Postman by David Brin - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Absolutely brilliant. A story of humanity at its worst, and what one person, one belief, and one strong will can do — and when it’s necessary to rely on others. A profoundly feminist work too, I imagine, for it’s time.

<p> We Free the Stars by Hafsah Faizal - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    An improvement from book one, since while that book was one long journey/mission, the sequel had the characters actually travel across multiple locations in the vibrant world, and go through many different reveals and obstacles besides one monster appearing out nowhere again and again.

    What makes this book hard to put down is the world Faizal explores more thoroughly -- but the relationships add strain that made it hard for me to enjoy any one character completely.

    The "romance" that was basically unresolved sexual tension based on miscommunication did not make sense to me, as the miscommunication stemmed from not saying anything versus saying the wrong thing, and both characters knew how the other felt. They simply just did 180s every time they interacted. The conflict between them felt very forced. A character we are meant to feel betrayed by doesn't linger in the uncertainty long enough. Another character we spent no time with we are meant to mourn their loss, and then move on from quickly anyways. A lot of their meaning was simply detached of any essence.

    The plot, however, was fun! But it lacked a charm of ingenuity, and instead felt very simple. Regardless, a 4/5 read for keeping my eyes glued to the page for days straight.
