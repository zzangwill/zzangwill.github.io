<p> A Venom Dark and Sweet by Judy Lin - 3/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Where A Magic Steeped in Poison felt original and unique, A Venom Dark and Sweet felt rudimentary and bland. The magic system, the biggest pull for the series, took a backseat for the classic big bad fight and trecherous journey to find something that is just handed to the main character. The book simply felt rushed and mismanaged, causing it to be a disappointment.

</ul>

<p> Babel, Or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators’ Revolution by RF Kuang - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    RF Kuang is a terrible person.

    She is a terrible person because her books so far have always take us on an intimate journey from the beginning of her character's lives and end with intense, tumultuous, and heart-wrenching climaxes. With her writing, she builds a relationship between with us, the reader, and the character (in this case, Robin), makes us care so deeply, makes us empathize and listen to his thoughts, and then TEARS US APART.

    Only someone terrible would do this!!

    But I freakin love it, and eat it up every time. So curse you RF Kuang, and thank you for writing such beautiful stories.

    -- note to self: should add a more analytic relfection later.

<p> We Hunt the Flame by Hafsah Faizal - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I definitely enjoyed We Hunt the Flames, but it reads like a stereotypical table-top campaign with predictable twists and instantly recognizable trope-filled story lines. Enjoyable, like I said, but not stimulating in its ingenuity.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Witch and the Tsar by Olesya Salnikova Gilmore - 3-4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Although I am giving this book four stars, I personally did not like it that much. Despite the author mentioning years pass in a matter of just a few paragraphs, the book moved terribly slow. For some reason, I just felt as though nothing was really happening, despite the war, atrocities, and families progressing in the background. But I think that was it — all of the story happened in the background, with Yaga herself not actively participating until the very end. She does come across as independent, intelligent, and wise, but if you remove her from the middle Russia’s turmoil, nothing would be different until the end.

    So why does this book earn four stars? Because I think my lack of enjoyment and boredom does not discount Gilmore’s work. She paints Russia in the 1500s in such vivid images, and gives the readers a story grounded in many real-life events that it becomes educational. All of this is to be commended. And her story that did not inspire me might be satisfying for others!
