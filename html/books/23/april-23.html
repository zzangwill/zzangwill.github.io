<p> Wings of Shadow by Nicki Pau Preto - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While not the most thrilling ending I expected from the series, it was still fun and well done. While decidedly YA, the climax still felt as though the stakes were not as great as they were meant to be. But I cannot fault a book for being what is was meant to be, and no more. (I still love Tristan, but Kade/Sev >>> in this book.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Bone Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart- 3.75/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It might be saying something that my favorite character is the animal that almost has no lines in the book, but even so the rest of the cast isn't too bad. It is simply the repetition that drags my opinion on them "I told him no, my heart wrenching with the lie" or "why was I talking to an animal"? happened too many times.</p>

   <p>Regardless the world is fascinating, but I feel like the ending happened without Lin really thinking of the consequences... but maybe that will be addressed next book.</p>

<p>And I pretty much loved the writing, but Stewart does use "thing" as a descriptor about three times, which is a cop out. One time she said "it was an iron thing" an I truly did not know if she was talking about the key or the gate, because "thing" is a poor descriptor.</p>
<p>Mephi is 10/10</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea by Axie Oh - 2.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Advertised as a Korean Ghibli book, I definitely get that impression but the artistry did not come through for the execution to be riveting. While reading, my mind was mostly blank as imagry fell flat. I loved the inspiration for the story and culture exposure, but the actual story itself needed some work. Explanations too, were lacking, and the timeline felt rushed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Cat Who Saved Books by S≈çsuke Natsukawa - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Books teach us empathy. Books connect generations, cultures, languages, and more. This is what <i>The Cat Who Saved Books</i> is about. Honestly, part of it felt like a call-out. To simply become a recluse and read, and not engage with the world is not appropriate. Yet this is exactly what I wanted to do when I picked up this book, and it told me not to. It is crazy how books find us just when we need them.</p>

   <p>Instead, you must take what you learn from books and use them as positive influences in other people's lives to give books a purpose and a soul. This book also teaches perseverance through strife. To quote: "If you're going to climb, make it a tall mountain. The view will be so much better." Same with  perseverance but with patience: hurrying does not give insight; taking a beat and breather is okay and encouraged.</p>

<p>Easy to read but overflowing with insight, <i>The Cat Who Saved Books</i> is a fantastic read. And be sure not to rush through it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Immortal King Rao, by Vauhini Vara - 3.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Vara has undeniable talent when it comes to weaving intricate storylines overflowing with precise language and pinpricks of asides that add to the overall narrative. And she does all this while commenting on humanity's purpose and role, creating a complex argument but still leaving me with many questions.</p>

   <p>What is the purpose of living? Do we live to make the future better, to constantly connect the world uplifting society? Is it not enough to be happy with our own lives? To what end does technology improve versus impede?</p>

<p>When we value everything under the guise of Social Capital, which Vara uses in her novel, I wonder how exactly that value is decided. Society values what it values, and it becomes a complex spiral of therefore it is valued and its value is decided; when an outlier surfaces, if it goes against the grain yet is true, its "social capital", or worth, will be severely undervalued. No matter what, intrinsic bias lives on.</p>

<p>Complicated and raw, while brilliant, the book does falter at the third act as the pacing rushes with revelations and a dissatisfying resolution. But perhaps that is the point, in parallel to our own reality.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
