<p> Daughter of No Worlds by Carissa Broadbent - 4.25/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The internet was right, this book is laced with something to make it addicting.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Blood Trials by N. E. Davenport - 4.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Blunt, brutal, and pulls no punches, much like the main character. The open writing that discusses sexism and racism perfectly balances on the beam of accurately reflecting our world and not being pushed on this fictional one just for commentary's sake.</p>

   <p> Ikenna's personality is 100% convincing that while sometimes I grew frustrated with her decisions and actions, I fully understood why she would behave in such a way, which attests to Davenport's excellent character portrayal.</p>

<p>Anxiously awaiting for the sequel, in both excitement and apprehension... </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<p> Crown of Feathers by Nicki Pau Preto 3.75/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Simply a fun book to read. No major complaints. Definitely YA, since for many of the plot points and/or twists I anticipated, but that's okay. The girl-pretending-to-be-a-boy felt very reminiscent of Alanna from Song of the Lioness by Tamora Pierce, which I enjoyed since that was an old childhood favorite of mine. Plus, I am a sucker for pheonixes.

<p> Skin of the Sea by Natasha Bowen 2.75/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A worthwhile story to read with many important topics, history, and not commonly written about mythology that I enjoyed learning about. However, I did not love the writing style and none of the characters stood out to me, in a sense where I almost felt they were all interchangeable. I cannot really describe their personalities. The tension between the two love interests, also, was not developed thoroughly enough in my mind, and all the dialogue felt off-kilter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also think I am not a fan of the repeated flashback/memory sequences, so a lot of this lower rating is probably just about preference.
