<p> Daughter of No Worlds by Carissa Broadbent - 4.25/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The internet was right, this book is laced with something to make it addicting.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Blood Trials by N. E. Davenport - 4.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Blunt, brutal, and pulls no punches, much like the main character. The open writing that discusses sexism and racism perfectly balances on the beam of accurately reflecting our world and not being pushed on this fictional one just for commentary's sake.</p>

   <p> Ikenna's personality is 100% convincing that while sometimes I grew frustrated with her decisions and actions, I fully understood why she would behave in such a way, which attests to Davenport's excellent character portrayal.</p>

<p>Anxiously awaiting for the sequel, in both excitement and apprehension... </p>
  </li>

<p> Crown of Feathers by Nicki Pau Preto 3.75/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Simply a fun book to read. No major complaints. Definitely YA, since for many of the plot points and/or twists I anticipated, but that's okay. The girl-pretending-to-be-a-boy felt very reminiscent of Alanna from Song of the Lioness by Tamora Pierce, which I enjoyed since that was an old childhood favorite of mine. Plus, I am a sucker for pheonixes.

<p> Skin of the Sea by Natasha Bowen 2.75/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A worthwhile story to read with many important topics, history, and not commonly written about mythology that I enjoyed learning about. However, I did not love the writing style and none of the characters stood out to me, in a sense where I almost felt they were all interchangeable. I cannot really describe their personalities. The tension between the two love interests, also, was not developed thoroughly enough in my mind, and all the dialogue felt off-kilter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also think I am not a fan of the repeated flashback/memory sequences, so a lot of this lower rating is probably just about preference.

<p> Descendant of the Crane by Joan He 3.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This book might be an embodiment of delayed gratification. While the first 50, 60% of this book was slow, when it finally started moving along, all the previous buildup and layering came together in a really nice way. This style of a glacier-like pace of a build might not be a style of storytelling that everyone will enjoy. And while I can appreciate it, I did not love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do think that this book would have done well as an adult novel, not a young adult novel. Many of the topics discussed were mature, and the book does not shy away from depicting atrocities. But the access to the depths necessary to really make a more impactful comment on these topics was not available due to the age rating restriction. Furthermore, the country being ran by a bunch of teenagers after the king dies does not strike me as believable anymore, although maybe that is my own age showing.

<p> The Bird King by Willow G Wilson 3/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I am conflicted about this book. On one hand, the prose was beautiful, although I could not always comprehend the writing even though I am sure it was profound. The main character either found strength in her body, or was constantly objectified. The friendship was either cute or 100% toxic. The story was either about the journey or it was dragging on too long. So overall, it's an unsure read.

<p> The Midnight Library by Matt Haig 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While the end of the book --seeing the love and possibilities available to you in your life, and not lament on what could have been-- was easily guessed, I still enjoyed this novel. The journey and many lives of Nora Seed were fun and exciting, and seeing the connections of her current life and divergents was interesting. However, the feelings of regret are very real to me even though I understand all the points this novel explains to try and make people feel better. I do think I am in a maze everyone else has navigated and they are watching me flounder with no way of finding the proper exit. I am a waste of many oppurtunities. But the narrator was very food and gave off a Fleabag vibe!

<p> Blood Scion by Deborah Falaye 4.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I really enjoyed this read not because it was fun and escapist -- but because it was brutal and dark. I admit ignorance on the details of child soldiers... only awareness that it occured, and learning more about it even in fiction is a good introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I thought it was interesting because Blood Scion felt like a mixture of Blood Trials and Skin of the Sea. Deadly, ruthless challenges for soldiers to go through depicting racism and misogyny like The Blood Trials, but the Yoruvba myths from Skin of the Sea. Much more YA than The Blood Trials, and better writing (in my opinion) than Skin of the Sea. But it goes to show that while I did not particularly like Skin of the Sea, the introduction to Yoruba gods and mythology made it so the names were familiar in this book when they were mentioned. Having a background made it easier to digest the second time around, so I am glad I read Skin of the Sea before this.
