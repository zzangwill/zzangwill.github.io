<p> Daughter of No Worlds by Carissa Broadbent - 4.25/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The internet was right, this book is laced with something to make it addicting.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Blood Trials by N. E. Davenport - 4.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Blunt, brutal, and pulls no punches, much like the main character. The open writing that discusses sexism and racism perfectly balances on the beam of accurately reflecting our world and not being pushed on this fictional one just for commentary's sake.</p>

   <p> Ikenna's personality is 100% convincing that while sometimes I grew frustrated with her decisions and actions, I fully understood why she would behave in such a way, which attests to Davenport's excellent character portrayal.</p>

<p>Anxiously awaiting for the sequel, in both excitement and apprehension... </p>
  </li>
</ul>
