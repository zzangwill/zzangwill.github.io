<p> Kingdom of the Feared by Kerri Maniscalco- 2/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The conclusion to a paranormal fantasy, I was pretty disappointed. Seemed like the author just wanted to write smut for the two main characters - the plot seemed to be a second thought. I never truly felt the power and fear the author tried to portray, and the mystery portion of the plot fell flat. Emilia is cool, I suppose, but her detective skills did not impress - she simply went around having conversations. ANd her giving up her powers was too quickly resolved: she lost and regained it all in the span of a minute and I was too detached to care. Devil/Hell stuff intruiges me, but the lore was secondary to Wrath/Emilia fucking literally every other chapter.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> I'm Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy - 4/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I cannot deny the bravery Jennette must have exposing her story to the world, but compared to the hype around this  memior I was not particularly impressed with the writing nor did I feel changed from having read this. It is easy and digestible (because despite what I said, yes she is a good writer), but Jennette discusses topics I feel like I know about already. Undoubtably others do not  and probably got more out of this book than I. I will say coming to terms with acknowledging someone hurt you while continuing to love them is powerful.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Lirael by Garth Nix - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
   Lirael by Garth Nix introduces us to a new protagonist in his Sabriel universe, and benefits from it. Lirael, unlike Sabriel, is lost and unsure of who she is, in contrast to the confident and strong character that Sabriel was. WHile not much happens plot-wise in this book (it is a lot of set-up), Lirael's self-discovery is a joy to embark upon.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Abhorsen by Garth Nix - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    All the revelations in this book that had been building up from book one almost melted my brain, it was so brilliantly executed and beautifully thought out. Might have shed a tear for the Disreputable Dog.

    Nixâ€™s imagination regarding death is one that I believe is so extraordinary and creative that when reading it, it both brings more meaning to death itself and makes you experience the cold, draining feeling of the river and the waterfalls he described. I loved every line that gave (excuse the poor pun) death more life. 5/5, 10/10, 100/100 </li>
   <li>
     I absolutely adored and devoured these sequels to Sabriel. Sabriel was amazing, but going on a journey of self-discovery that evolves into becoming confident, brave, and strong-willed with Lirael added to my enjoyment in contrast to Sabriel already being confertable in her self-value and identity. The dives and descriptions of death too were more highly developed and explored in Lirael/Abhorsen, which was my main point of intruige. Going all the way to the Ninth Gate was just so thrilling. The contrast of the raging and powerful waters of One through Eight versus the tranquil stars of Nine really gives Death a feeling of peace and rightfullness in the time you must depart, especially as the Ninth Gate can refuse you. Nix's further dive into Free Magic versus Charter Magic, and how the two came to be was rewarding. I wonder if the Seven (as reflected in the Bells) thought Free Magic would have always needed to be contained, and Orannis was just the tipping point? What if Charter and Free were not so seperate? Nix's work really brings to mind the idea of balance and second chances. Brilliant series, a new favorite of mine.</li>
