</body>

<p> Tread of Angels by Rebecca Roanhorse - 3/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A short novel that was fun to read but felt like it focused on the wrong things. I wanted more storytelling, more character development, not investigating and having everything spelled out to me. But maybe that is the challenge with novellas.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> This Woven Kingdom by Tahereh Mafi - 3.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Somehow nothing really happens in the first 75% of this book, but it still captured my attention and kept my mind reflecting on its passages throughout the day. 
    </p>

   <p> The instant-love is not my cup of tea, but the dialogue between the two main love interests is entertaining and brilliant. The verbiage is quite formal in the dialogue versus the female MC’s dialogue with other characters, and I’m not sure if that’s the authors style as I haven’t read her other work (and she does spend a lot of fancy words in her descriptions) or she’s exaggerating it to mark the difference between educations in the book as that’s a topic brought up a lot. </p>

<p>Overall it would have been a 3 stars for an enjoyable read but nothing novel or mind-blowing…. but the last 50 pages were exciting, and the last sentence actually cracked me up. So another .5 stars for that. I will read book 2, and am interested to see where this goes.  </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<p> Brave New World by Aldux Huxley - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Frighteningly becoming increasingly relevant as each day progresses, Brave New World was an uncomfortable read in a very purposeful way. With some obviously dated phrases, the ideas of Brave New World still come across as very modern and applicable to daily life. Afraid of isolation, afraid of boredom... not thinking for yourself, needing to be constantly stimulated, the self-fulfilling prophecy of generating a human destined for self-thinking but not allowing them too much self-governance and forcing them to create others who ask for dominance... It's quite a lot to absorb, and as I am finding out, a instant reflection becomes unfocused trying to come to terms with everything Huxley discusses. </p>

   <p> In short, a fascinating read. 5/5. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Heart of Flames by Nicki Pau Preto - 4.75/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A book that does not even know the phrase "second book syndrome". I loved this second installment that deepened the world-building, political lore, and character motivations in this exhilarating series.</p>

   <p> I also absolutely LOVE how the characters in this book do not shy away from confrontation in any sense of the word. Yes, between the sisters(?) in conflict, but also between the love interests. The second there is a sense of uncertainty, instead of wallowing in miscommunication and disgust at the idea of simply talking, the characters approach one another immediately to sort out the issue. It's a breath of fresh air to have conflict arise from more drastic and series sources.</p>

<p>I cannot wait to read the third book, all the set up and tension is certain to explode. (Also, Tristan has my whole heart. He's such a pure soul.) </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman</p>

<p> The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty - 5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Explosive, adventurous, and a brilliant return to Chakraborty's writing with a stunning new heroine to lead the way. Full of lush history, culture, and diversity, Shannon proves that she can write a book that doubles as a standalone should one wish it to end on curiosities or a book that promises more excitement in the next installments.</p>

   <p> There is also something fulfilling and wonderful in a book starring a woman that is harsh, does not hold back her strength, and is a doting, loving mother with tenderness in her heart for her family blood or non-blood related. Chakraborty did not shy away from writing some of the most nuanced women in her previous novels, but in this book, that artistry shines once more in not just the protagonist once again.</p>

<p>I was both saddened and happy to find this book is not a standalone, as now I have more adventures with Amina Al-Sirafi in my future, but those are just what I said they are -- in a future that has not arrived yet. I love Shannon's mind, and I am waiting restlessly for the her next book!!! </p>
