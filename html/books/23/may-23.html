<p> The Blood Gift by NE Davenport - 3.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I gotta say, the writing and pacing of this book compared to the first felt off to me. The sophistication was not there anymore, and the story/themes felt too simple to be considered a well-rounded novel. The intricacies of racism, sexism, and violence that were touched upon in the first book did not play a big part in this novel. Furthermore, I feel like we only got a touch on the magical side of Ikenna's heritage: and are told, rather then shown, what she can do, and this is not explored very well leaving me wanting for more from the world-building. Plus the character development I hoped for Ikenna to have in this book all but vanished in a few chapters, as it was evident her rash decision making was going to continue to happen, and somehow continue to work. Only so many times can I read her bloodlusting thoughts and not think it is getting repetitive, or childish as one character in this book points out (and they are correct).

   <p>However, the ride is still enjoyable, the feminine rage is amazing, and the revenge is satisfactory. </p>

<p> Seven Faceless Saints - 3.5/5 stars</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An interesting premise for a murder mystery as it is shadowed by the themes of religion, hypocrisy, lies, and the effects of war. However, the characters actions and decisions frequently either made me frustrated or simply confused. Regardless, I enjoyed the short read, and am excited for the next installment.</p>
