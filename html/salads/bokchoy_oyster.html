                    2 tablespoons oil

                   3/4 cup water

                <li class="ingredient">
                   5 tablespoons oyster sauce
                </li>
                <li class="ingredient">
                    1 tablespoon cornstarch
                 </li>
                 <li class="ingredient">
                   1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar (or mirin)

                Bring a pot of water to a boil.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
              Meanwhile, prepare the baby bok choy by removing any undesirable leaves and trimming away the excess root on the bok choy. Then, cut the bok choy in half, lengthwise, or quartered. Wash and rinse the baby bok choy well to get rid of any dirt, especially between the leaves.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Blanche the bok choy by placing them in the boiling water. Cook briefly, about 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the leaves are bright green and the stems are just cooked. Drain and set aside. *If you prefer your bok choy more tender, cook it for a little longer.*
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                In a bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the water, oyster sauce, sugar, and cornstarch until no more clumps of cornstarch is visible. Set aside until needed. *The amount of cornstarch used give the sauce just enough body. If you prefer the sauce thicker, add another teaspoon or two of cornstarch to the sauce.*
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                In a wok or large pan over medium heat, add the 2 tablespoons of oil. Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and cook until fragrant.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Give the prepared sauce a good mix and pour into the wok or pan. Heat up the sauce until it becomes thickened and glossy. Make sure to stir frequently, especially when the sauce starts to thicken, so that the sauce can thicken evenly.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Once the sauce has evenly thickened, add the prepared bok choy and toss until everything is evenly coated with sauce. Serve and enjoy!
