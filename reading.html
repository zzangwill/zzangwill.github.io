Chakraborty</a><br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4882723466">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Explosive, adventurous, and a brilliant return to Chakraborty's writing with a stunning new heroine to lead the way. Full of lush history, culture, and diversity, Shannon proves that she can write a book that doubles as a standalone should one wish it to end on curiosities or a book that promises more excitement in the next installments.<br /><br />There is also something fulfilling and wonderful in a book starring a woman that is harsh, does not hold back her strength, and is a doting, loving mother with tenderness in her heart for her family blood or non-blood related. Chakraborty did not shy away from writing some of the most nuanced women in her previous novels, but in this book, that artistry shines once more in not just the protagonist once again.<br /><br />I was both saddened and happy to find this book is not a standalone, as now I have more adventures with Amina al-Sirafi in my future, but those are just what I said they are -- in a future that has not arrived yet. I love Shannon's mind, and I am waiting restlessly for the her next book!!!
