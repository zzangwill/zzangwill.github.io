        My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5034259173">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
        3-4 stars<br /><br />Sade Louise's debut novel exhibits a brilliantly spun story -- a mix of Supernatural, Lucifer, and X-Men. But while the premise and mystery keeps your interest piqued, and Lousie's writing conjures up great imagery, the lack of cleanliness that comes with indie publication is noticeable. The pacing, some punctuation plights, arrangement of the story (ie the first chapter being cut by 9 chapters in between until we get back to that moment), and some dialogue might have used some polishing. And while some reactions characters had after ley discounted may have been warranted, I did not feel a deep enough attachment to feel the pain as I possible could have been with more prior development. However! This does not discount the book Louise wrote that I consumed in two days. Ripe with clearly thought-out, deep lore, rich diversity, and great character relationships, I cannot wait for when the next in the series is released!
