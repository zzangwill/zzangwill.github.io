Chakraborty</a><br/>
        My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4831570236">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
        It was a genuine pleasure to return to the world of Daevabad. It is a testament to Chakraborty's talent and prowess that even after two years, by the end of the first sentence was transported to her universe of wonderful magic. The added stories to many characters, some who were not even alive during the main trilogy, were amazing. Some broke my heart while others made me smile, even while breaking my heart as I long for more of this world. Absolutely love love love it.
