My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5213167116">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Vara has undeniable talent when it comes to weaving intricate storylines overflowing with precise language and pinpricks of asides that add to the overall narrative. And she does all this while commenting on humanity's purpose and role, creating a complex argument but still leaving me with many questions.<br /><br />What is the purpose of living? Do we live to make the future better, to constantly connect the world, uplifting society? Is it not enough to be happy with our own lives? To what end does technology improve versus impede? <br /><br />When we value everything under the guise of Social Capital, which Vara uses in her novel, I wonder how exactly that value is decided. Society values what it values, and it becomes a complex spiral of therefore it is valued and its value is decided; when an outlier surfaces, if it goes against the grain yet is true, its "social capital", or worth, will be severely undervalued. No matter what, intrinsic bias lives on.<br /><br />Complicated and raw, while brilliant, the book does falter at the third act as the pacing rushes with revelations and a dissatisfying resolution. But perhaps that is the point, in parallel to our own reality.
