My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5017089920">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
After reading this book I have decided it is really less about Book Eaters themselves -- although their lore and beliefs are fascinating -- and more about the human (or rather, sentient being) experience. Devon, our protagonist, is hard to characterize. She literally fed false beliefs, indoctrinated from the moment she was birthed, and many times over the years has her world turned over its head as she realizes this. <br /><br />This book raises the questions of what makes a good person, and what choices we make to save those we love. But the most important debate, I think, is how anyone can change a system. Is this change even possible? What about when the system is set up for survival? Is it okay to change it, if it means the destruction of others? Do people only see the other side when they are negatively affected? I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I am grateful for them being brought up.
