        My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5333461400">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
        3.5<br /><br />The writing and pacing of this book compared to the first felt off to me. The sophistication was not there anymore, and the story/themes felt too simple to be considered a well-rounded novel. The intricacies of racism, sexism, and violence that were touched upon in the first book did not play a big part in this novel. Furthermore, I feel like we only got a touch on the magical side of Ikenna's heritage: and are told, rather then shown, what she can do, and this is not explored very well leaving me wanting for more from the world-building. Plus the character development I hoped for Ikenna to have in this book all but vanished in a few chapters, as it was evident her rash decision making was going to continue to happen, and somehow continue to work. Only so many times can I read her bloodlusting thoughts and not think it is getting repetitive, or childish as one character in this book points out (and they are correct).<br /><br />However, the ride is still enjoyable, the feminine rage is amazing, and the revenge is satisfactory.
